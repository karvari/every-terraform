# every-terraform
build out of all modules one could possibly need for literally everything

I've pulled in every single terraform resource, for every single architecture, and created a variety of modules from them. 
Maybe I hit your use case, maybe not, but you should be able to fork this bad boy, pair it down to only what you need, 
and use the examples I have created to build out your own infrastructure. 

Pre-reqs:

terraform installed
some understanding of how to use terraform
admin access to whichever cloud you are setting this up in
